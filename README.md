# Predicting House Prices Using Machine Learning

This project applies the Data Science methodology to estimate housing prices based on various property features. The analysis includes data exploration, data cleaning, modeling and evaluation, and generating predictions using machine learning techniques.

## Problem Definition
Real estate buyers and agencies need a reliable way to estimate house prices based on property characteristics. The question we aim to answer is:

**"Can we accurately predict house prices using historical data and relevant property features?"**

## Data Source
The dataset contains housing-related attributes such as lot area, number of rooms, neighborhood features, and sale prices. For users who do not have the actual dataset, a small synthetic dataset is generated to ensure the notebook can run independently.

## Methodology
This project follows the Data Science methodology, including:
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment (basic demonstration inside the notebook)

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
Both models were able to learn relationships between features and sale price. The Random Forest model provided better predictive performance than Linear Regression in this experiment.

## Notebook Link
The full Jupyter Notebook with code, results, and visualizations is included in this repository.
